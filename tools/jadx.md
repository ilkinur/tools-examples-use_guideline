jadx: The jadx suite allows you to simply load an APK and look at its Java source code. Whatâ€™s happening under the hood is that jADX is decompiling the APK to smali and then converting the smali back to Java.


Usage:

jadx -d [path-output-folder] [path-apk-or-dex-file]




jadx-gui:  UI version of jadx
